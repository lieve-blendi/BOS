### **!! BOS is not finished yet !!**
BOS is an open-source OS made from scratch for the OpenComputers minecraft mod.

# What does it provide by default?
It provides, or will provide soon enough:
- Basic driver system with a few built-in drivers
- A basic filesystem API
- A fancy boot-up sequence because yes
