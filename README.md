# KOCOS
Kernel for OpenComputers Operating Systems or KOCOS is a open-source kernel made from scratch to build custom operating systems for the OpenComputers minecraft mod.

# What does it provide by default?
It provides, or will provide soon enough:
- Basic driver system with built-in drivers
- A basic filesystem API
- A fancy boot-up sequence because yes
